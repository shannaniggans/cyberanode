# Get your company listed on CyberAnode

We would love to get your Australian based company listed here! In order to do that though, you'll need to follow a bit of a process.

## 1. Create a new issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/shannaniggans/cyberanode/issues/new/choose)
* Choose the "Company registration request" template.
* Add your company name into the title: `[Registration request] - your company name Pty Ltd`.
* Make sure you meet the criteria.
* Fill out the details as requested and check off the boxes as you go. Most information is required.
* Products and services should be listed separately, a category should be chosen for each. The categories should be high level but a good description, we'll consolidate categories as we see fit. Some examples can be found [here](categories.md).
* If you resell any companies, we'll have those as tags on each company profile page, so if someone was looking for a Crowdstrike reseller for example they can filter on those.

Feel free to add extra comments or suggestions.
